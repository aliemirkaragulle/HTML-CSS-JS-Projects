                Hello, I am Ali. I have a long-standing passion for art films and for this reason I have created this website for providing some content for film lovers.
                There are several links below which will take you to the specified directors page. In the corresponding pages, you will find information ranging
                from directors lives to their filmographies. The directors I have chosen are Wong Kar Wai and Andrei Tarkovsky. I believe that these two directors touch the soul of a
                human and deserve to be felt by those who are brave enough. Besides, there is a page that leads to an enjoyable quiz which focuses on the directors films.

            <p>
                My favorite film directors are Wong Kar Wai and Andrei Tarkovski. Wong Kar Wai is a master of sense. How he uses light, colours, sound, clothes
                and storyline mesmerize the viewer and touches hearts. Andrei Tarkovski is a master of soul. From the messages of films to his special technique,
                he is such a director that I can promise you his films will show you different realities of the world, give you a glimpse of stun and terrify you.
