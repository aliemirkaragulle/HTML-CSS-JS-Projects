                    Wong Kar-wai BBS (born 17 July 1958) is a Hong Kong film director, screenwriter, and producer. His films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong is considered a contemporary auteur, and ranks third on Sight & Sound's 2002 poll of the greatest filmmakers of modern times.[note 1] His films frequently appear on best-of lists domestically and internationally.
                    Born in Shanghai, Wong emigrated to British Hong Kong as a child with his family. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama As Tears Go By (1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles. Days of Being Wild (1990), his first venture into such direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time (1994), was met with mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre.
                    The production of Ashes of Time was time-consuming and left Wong exhausted; he subsequently directed Chungking Express (1994) with hopes of reconciling with filmmaking.[note 2] The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong consolidated his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival.
                    The 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046 (2004) and The Grandmaster (2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

                <p>
                    Wong is known for producing art films focussed on mood and atmosphere, rather than following convention.[132] His general style is described by Teo as "a cornucopia overflowing with multiple stories, strands of expression, meanings and identities: a kaleidoscope of colours and identities".[133] Structurally, Wong's films are typically fragmented and disjointed,[134] with little concern for linear narrative,[135] and often with interconnected stories.[136] Critics have commented on the lack of plot in his films,[137] such as Burr who says: "The director doesn't build linear story lines so much as concentric rings of narrative and poetic meaning that continually revolve around each other".[85] Similarly, Brunette says that Wong "often privileges audio/visual expressivity over narrative structure".[138] Wong has commented on this, saying "in my logic there is a storyline."[8]
                    Key to Wong's films is the visual style, which is often described as beautiful and unique.[6][101] The colours are bold and saturated, the camerawork swooning, resulting in what Brunette calls his "signature visual pyrotechnics".[8][139] One of his trademarks is the use of step-printing,[8] which alters film rates to "[liquefy] hard blocks of primary colour into iridescent streaks of light."[12] Other features of the Wong aesthetic include slow motion,[94] off-centre framing,[140] the obscuring of faces,[141] rack focus,[142] filming in the dark or rain,[143] and elliptical editing.[144] Schneider writes of Wong's fondness for "playing with film stock, exposure, and speed the way others might fiddle with a script."[44]
                    Another trademark of Wong's cinema is his use of music and pop songs.[143] He places great importance on this element,[145] and Biancorosso describes it as the "essence" of his films; a key part of the "narrative machinery" that can guide the rhythm of the editing.[146] He selects international songs, rarely cantopop, and uses them to enhance the sense of history or place.[147] According to film scholar Julian Stringer, music "proved crucial to the emotional and cognitive appeal" of Wong's films.[148]
                    Wong's dependence on music and his heavily visual and disjointed style has been compared to music videos,[149] but detractors claim that they are "all surface and no depth".[9] Academic Curtis K. Tsui argues that style is the substance in Wong's film, while Brunette believes that his "form remains resolutely in the service of character, theme, and emotion rather than indulged in for its own sake".[150]
